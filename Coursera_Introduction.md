# Coursera Introduction/Business Problem

In this project I will assess the similarity between the cities of Toronto, Canada and London, Great Britain. 
This assessment could help someone that is moving between the two cities in deciding the neighbourhoods that are similar to the one where they currently live. Because I am using crime data in the analysis, this information can also help security companies pursue their customers from high crime rate neighbourhoods and can also be used by landlords in implementing extra security measures for the buildings that they own in order to increase safety in and around their building.
