# Data Description

I have started collecting my data with web scraping wikipedia pages for the neighbourhood names in each city, then organising the information into data frames. 
For the crime information I have downloaded crime datasets for each city from the respective police stations and I have resumed it to a data frame containing the neighbourhood name and total crimes in the years 2015-2016 in each neighbourhood, for each city. Afterwards I have combined the resulting data frames and created a map visualisation of each neighbourhood with its respective crime rates.

For the analysis I am using Fourquare location data of nine different categories of venues, based on they Foursquare ID. My analysis is based on the following types of venues: Arts & Entertainment, Colleges, Restaurants, Night Life, Outdoors & Recreation, Government Buildings, Medical Centers, Spiritual Centers and Grocery Shops.
I am using crime statistics for the two cities in order to have a metric that could influence the clustering based on the safety of the neighbourhoods.
The program will count how many venues of each type are on a 500m radius in each neighbourhood and then the crime statistics will be added before the clustering.
